# Find markers in Google Maps API circle detect

## What exactly does this do?

Let's say you draw a circle with the radius you want at a location you want on the map. This point is important for you, it could be school, home or something else... You want to know if someone entered and left here, technically speaking, if there was a geofence process. It meets exactly this need.

There is no need for a special library, software or plugin for this. Solved with mathematical formulas, a free resource.

## What are the expected results?

## Would increasing the comma in the latitude, longitude value help me?

Certainly. If there is a mathematical calculation in the location data, whether there is latitude-longitude or not, the frequency of the numbers after the comma is an inevitable option for more accurate and precise calculation of the result.

Map images, design and other necessary infrastructures are integrated with processes running on the Google Maps API side and their server. Therefore, it is necessary to have a Console Cloud account with a starting or specific quota. If you do not have an account, to open and become a member;
